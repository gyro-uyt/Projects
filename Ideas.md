## 1. Padnote

This would be like a note-pad but in Reverse direction.  

**Idea:**  
What happens in notepads is as we write cursor moves with the words and lines.  
In this project cursor will remain at same fixed position in starting and words will go ahead as you write so does the lines you write.  
*Like a chat app reversed — but for journaling*

**Aim:**  
latest notes should appear right in begining and old ones at end, kinda like how gallery shows the latest photos at top and old at bottom.

**Reason:**  
I want to write daily logs/journals like in Diary but found difficulty as when i start a Note and write todays then over the days, then what happens is latest ones which should appear first are all at bottom of the and oldest are at top.

**Practicality:**  
Very subjective as it is an unconventional way of writing but I think it is practical for few atleast for those who writes daily logs.

**Other Solution:**  
One can maintain different notes for each day and have them displac is sort-by-modified order but as these are daily logs they can be a lots of these, also these are not necessary and Not manage-able, whereas my solution will only make one file.
